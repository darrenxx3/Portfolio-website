# Getting started with NPM/ Nodemon
This website is using local NPM, so make sure to setup it first

## Setup
1. Clone this repository first on your local device
2. Install nodemon or npm by typing `npm install` / `npm install nodemon` on your terminal (in this case I use VS code terminal).
3. After installing, you can type `nodemon run` / `nodemon` on the terminal to launch the localhost
4. Open your browser and type https://localhost:3000 to see the result
